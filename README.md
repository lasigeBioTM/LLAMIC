## Overview

**LLaMIC** is a modular pipeline designed for clinical entity recognition and standardization, focusing on identifying **cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease mentions** in unstructured electronic health records (EHR) free-text notes.

LLaMIC combines instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) with rule-based lexicons to achieve:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Recognition of disease mentions within ICD-10 codes I20â€“I25 (ischemic heart diseases) and I60â€“I64 (cerebrovascular diseases).
- **Named Entity Linking (NEL):** Linking recognized entities to standardized ICD-10 concepts.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install required dependencies in your environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the model and lexicon paths in `call_llamic.sh`: Select the entity type (disease or drug) and specify the LLaMA model to use for the NER, NEL, and review phases. You can choose the LLaMA 3.1 8B model (llama3.1) or provide the path to your own fine-tuned checkpoints. Update the domain lexicon (lexicon.csv) with the target ICD-10 codes for diseases or MeSH codes and descriptions for drugs. Adjust the n_iterations parameter for NER if needed.

```bash
--entity_type disease/drug
--model_name_or_path_ner llama3.1 (default)
--model_name_or_path_nel llama3.1 (default)
--model_name_or_path_review llama3.1 (default)

--lexicon_path $datadir/lexicon.csv
--n_iterations 1 (default)
```


Run the LLaMIC on HPC with SLURM:
```bash
sbatch call_llamic.sh
```

## Results
The fine-tuned LAMIC model was evaluated on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and ICD-10 entity linking tasks. In MIMIC-IV notes dataset, it achieved precision scores of 0.83 (strict mode) and 0.89 (lenient mode) for disease identification. For ICD-10 linking, the model reached a precision of approximately 0.82.
